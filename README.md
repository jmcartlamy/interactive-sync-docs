# Interactive Sync - Documentation

Interactive Sync is a **boilerplate** to create and configure a [Twitch extension](https://www.twitch.tv/p/extensions/) for [twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/), promoting interactions between Twitch community and any application in a whole new level.

-   [Extension Backend Service](https://github.com/jmcartlamy/interactive-sync-ebs/) (EBS)
