## Guidelines and policies

### Disclaimer

When you decide to integrate our extension **"Interactive Sync"**, keep in mind you must abide to **[Twitch Guidelines and policies](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/extensions/guidelines-and-policies)**, including:

-   [Developer Services Agreement](https://www.twitch.tv/p/fr-fr/legal/developer-agreement/),
-   [Terms of Service](https://www.twitch.tv/p/fr-fr/legal/terms-of-service/),
-   [Community Guidelines](https://www.twitch.tv/p/fr-fr/legal/community-guidelines/).

### Register your application

In addition, you must **[register your application](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)** on Twitch to be able to use our extension for the following reasons:

1. We use the "client ID" of your application to establish a secure websocket connection with our EBS, including a request on a Twitch API to get several informations of the current streamer. This means that **if Twitch has revoked your application** due to non-compliance with their rules, their API and our back-end **will reject the connection** with an error.

2. We keep and associate the "client ID" with each connection to prevent possible non-compliance with the twitch rules through the messages sent in JSON. **If any twitch rules are found to have been broken, your application will be added on our blacklist, without warning**, in order to comply with the twitch guidelines and policies.

## Architectural Reference

Our extension is built following the terms described in [Twitch's official documentation](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/extensions#architectural-reference). This includes several important points listed below.

### Identity

Initially, a front extension does not have access to the identity of the viewer that is using it. By default, an opaque identifier is retrieved by EBS when the viewer is logged out of Twitch or is logged in without having given its permission. If the viewer is logged into Twitch and have given its permission, a proper identifier is received by EBS. ([source](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/extensions#identity))

**Messages between our EBS and your application DOES NOT INCLUDED that proper or opaque identifier**. Instead, you receive the current `display_name` of the user or a string named _"Anonymous"_.

### Extension Types

We provide several types of extensions for developers to use: Overlay Extension, Panel Extension and Mobile Extension.

-   Overlay Extension displays on top of the whole video as a transparent overlay.
-   Panel Extension sits with the rest of the user profile content at the bottom of a Twitch channel.
-   Mobile Extension can operates at the same time as one of the two previous ones.

You can use each type through the [User Interface](/docs/getting-started/create-ui#view-components).

:::important

When a streamer select the extension's type _(video overlay or panel)_ in the configuration field, the type chosen is displayed on his channel and the others types are ignored.

### Restrictions on content

Custom styles can be used to customize components. Many CSS properties are allowed including `background` or `border-image` and many values can be set as a source image.

To see the current Content Security Policy, check the [Twitch reference](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/extensions#restrictions-on-content) about it.

### Designing Extensions

**Interactive Sync followed the general guidelines of Twitch** when creating layout components and design of the light and dark themes.

If you desire to customize components, you have to **[follow all guidelines offered by Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/extensions/designing)**. A deliberately misleading, inaccessible or unusable design risk to your application a removal from our white list.
